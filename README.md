# Tutoring-App
This is the final individual project that I designed and implemented for my COMP 132- Advanced Programming course in Fall 2022 using Java and Java Swing. The aim was to create a one-to-one tutoring system application which consisted of three different user interfaces for students, tutors and an administrator. The project is based on the many concepts of object oriented programming, especially inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and simple GUI design using Java Swing.
